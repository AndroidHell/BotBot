# Botbot, v1.2

Botbot is a for fun project based on the inside joke from reddit.

"Long ago, in a galaxy far away...

There was an askreddit post where someone asked the quesiton, 'how many bots are there on reddit' to whcih the brunt of the comment section was filled with users posting the comment 'Everyone is a bot except you.'"

At some point, I was taling in the Empeopled IRC chat about making a bot that says that whenever someone typed the word "bot".

Then I actually made it.

This might be the stupidest thing I ahve ever done code-wise.
